In our last study, we reviewed 44 deep learning-based studies published between 2018 and 2023 in the field of surgical workflow analysis and identified several critical challenges that researchers are currently facing. In this post, we will investigate these challenges.

Accurately recognizing surgical phases and procedural steps remains a complex task. These challenges can be broadly divided into two main categories:

- Model-based challenges stem from the design, architecture, and optimization of deep learning models.
- Data-based challenges involve the availability, diversity, and quality of datasets used for training, validation, and testing. 


### Model-Based Challenges
---

##### **1. Temporal Relation Modeling:** 

A well-known problem in surgical workflow analysis is aggregating the necessary long-term temporal information into an estimation at the current time step. This information is vital when the data window used for estimation does not contain sufficient distinctive information to generate reliable outputs.

##### **2. Class-Imbalance::**

While the accurate recognition of all surgical phases is equally important from a clinical perspective, the distribution of samples across these phases is often highly imbalanced. This class imbalance negatively affects model learning by biasing predictions toward overrepresented classes, complicates the evaluation of model performance, and increases the likelihood of misclassifying or entirely missing shorter phases or rare steps. The imbalance typically arises because certain phases involve more complex or numerous actions and therefore naturally occupy longer durations in the procedure.

##### **3. Input Noise:**

Noisy inputs degrade short-term temporal consistency and significantly complicate the classification task. In endoscopic video data of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), noise can be introduced by various sources: blood or moisture covering the camera lens, temporary removal of the scope for cleaning, misalignment or loss of focus on the surgical field, or unintentional camera motion that causes blurry frames. These noisy frames disrupt the visual context and may lead to erroneous phase predictions.

##### **4. Modality:**

Different data modalities in surgical AI bring unique challenges and demand specialized techniques for effective feature extraction and model design.

- Video is the most commonly used modality, especially endoscopic videos in laparoscopic cholecystectomy and microscopic videos in cataract surgery. Key challenges include subtle visual cues, noisy frames, low variation between phases, and high variation within phases.

- Tool usage data‚Äîindicating which instruments are used and when‚Äîcan offer valuable context. However, it typically requires manual annotation, making it impractical for real-world use. While some approaches propose instrument modification (e.g., RFID tags or trackers), these solutions are not yet widely adopted.

- Audio, especially speech, presents a different set of hurdles. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems must contend with multiple expressions for the same concept, multilingual environments, off-topic dialogue, and background noise‚Äîall of which complicate accurate interpretation.

##### **5. Online/Offline Setting:**

An online algorithm performs surgical workflow analysis in real time, processing data sequentially as it becomes available. It relies solely on current and past information. In contrast, offline algorithms have access to the complete dataset and can perform more accurate analysis but they are limited in their use to post-operative scenarios.

Online recognition can support physicians during surgery by helping track procedural steps in real time and can also assist hospital administrators in optimizing operating room schedules. Offline recognition, on the other hand, is well-suited for post-surgical analysis, making it valuable for documentation, training, assessment, and educational purposes.

##### **6. Evaluation:**

Evaluating the performance of surgical workflow recognition models isn‚Äôt as straightforward as it might seem. One major challenge lies in choosing the right metrics‚Äîespecially when dealing with imbalanced datasets where some phases occur far less frequently than others.

Most studies rely on frame-wise metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Jaccard Index. While accuracy is widely reported, it can be misleading‚Äîit tends to overrepresent performance in dominant phases and underplay errors in shorter, rarer phases. That‚Äôs why metrics like F1 and Jaccard, which balance the importance of each phase, offer a more nuanced view.

To address limitations in standard metrics, researchers have also proposed custom evaluation strategies. These include measuring consistency over time, tracking delay errors, and using edit distances like the Levenshtein and segmental edit distance to evaluate how closely the predicted sequence matches the actual procedure.

### Data-Based Challenges
---

##### **1. Dataset Size:**

Despite growing efforts, limited availability of high-quality surgical data is still a major bottleneck. Regularity constraints, incompatibility of different data sources, insufficient and unstructured data storage, and hardware limitations are the current main problems for establishing large surgical data sources. Anonymization algorithms can help protect patient privacy and ease the establishment of new public datasets. Moreover, synthetic data generation can also be an alternative for creating large annotated data automatically.

##### **2. Operation Type:**

Each type of surgical procedure comes with its own unique structure, visual patterns, tools, and workflow dynamics. As a result, designing effective recognition algorithms often requires tailoring methods specifically to the characteristics of a given operation.

A technique that performs well for one procedure, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, may fail to generalize to others like cataract surgery or orthopedic interventions. Differences in camera views, tissue appearance, tool usage, and phase durations can all influence model performance.

##### **3. Annotation:**

The majority of the selected 44 studies focus on supervised learning. However, creating a large annotated dataset for fully supervised learning is a laborious and costly task. Collaborating medical experts define surgical phases or steps of interested operation type. Following annotation work in an entire dataset is either directly done or validated by medical experts. However, these definitions or annotations may not be universally accepted and can vary between experts. When multiple experts are contributing to the study, a strong correlation of their annotation or validation work is required to ensure a minimum degree of ambiguity and label noise.
